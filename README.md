## Characteristics

> Exciting 👓

- Purely offline local applications , code to see on open source.
- Vertical and horizontal spacing can be adjusted, the color of light and dark change at will.
- Rotate freely in all sizes and angles, text and pictures can be printed.
- The watermark repeats all over the picture, and it's a little hard for the bad guys to remove it.

> Seriously (pushes up glasses)

- **Security**.
  - The code is completely open source and uses a loose MIT protocol, you are free to Fork yourself to modify and remove code you think is problematic ;)
  - No network requests, no network request permissions, no fear of your photos being compromised. users with API >= 29 don't even need to request any permissions. (28 and below users need to apply for storage permissions to access and store photos)
  - And of course there are no stats, buried points or Device IDs, or even crash reporting (so if you get a crash, please share the crash info with us >_<).
  - We're forgoing the convenient third-party collection SDK and various stats just so you can use it with confidence. 
  **What's yours is yours**. 
- **Layout**: support for horizontal and vertical intervals between the watermark, automatically repeat the full picture.
- **Style**: font color, transparency, size and rotation angle can be adjusted.
- **Content**: Support text watermark and image watermark.

## Use
You can use it however you want. It is more suitable for situations where you need to submit a photo ID, a hand-held photo ID or a sensitive photo. Example.
- Various real names in the country, uploading front and back photos of ID cards at every turn, even handheld ID photos.
- Pre-project previews, samples, copyrighted or simply spoofed images

Reference text.
> This photo is for xx for xxx purposes only, no other use.

You can turn down the transparency, just don't block the key information.

> (For now) we can't (temporarily) prevent information from being uploaded, or even (temporarily) prevent information from being leaked, but we can reduce the value of the information being leaked.
>
> Even if it's (probably) useless in the end, at least you can disgust the leaker a bit.

## UI
